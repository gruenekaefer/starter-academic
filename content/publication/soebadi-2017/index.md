abstract: "Introduction Stem cells for sexual disorders are steadily being introduced\
  \ into clinical trials. Two conditions of importance are the main target for this\
  \ line of treatment, especially when regarding the wide array of translational and\
  \ basic science highlighting the potential advantages of regenerative therapy: erectile\
  \ dysfunction (ED) and more recently Peyronie disease (PD). Cellular therapy offers\
  \ a treatment modality that might reverse disease progression. It would be used\
  \ in a curative setting, in contrast to other pharmaceutical agents that are currently\
  \ available. Aim To review basic preclinical studies and recent clinical trials\
  \ of stem cells on ED and PD. Methods A search of the medical literature for the\
  \ following terms was performed using PubMed: stem cells, cellular therapy, erectile\
  \ dysfunction, Peyronie's disease, and clinical trial. Main Outcome Measures A non-systematic\
  \ narrative review and critical reflection on preclinical and clinical studies administering\
  \ stem cells for ED and PD in animal models and human subjects. Results Numerous\
  \ studies have confirmed the beneficial functional effects of stem cell injection\
  \ in established animal models on ED and PD. Various stem cell types have been adopted,\
  \ from embryonic to adult mesenchymal cell types. Each cell type offers distinctive\
  \ advantages and disadvantages. Diverse administrations of stem cells were investigated,\
  \ with insignificant variability in the ultimate results. Stem cells appear to have\
  \ a pronounced paracrine effect, rather than the classic engraftment and differentiation\
  \ hypothesis. Phase 1 clinical trials using stem cells have not reported any severe\
  \ adverse events in animals. However, these results cannot be extrapolated to draw\
  \ any conclusions about efficacy in human patients. Conclusion Stem cells have an\
  \ established efficacy in preclinical studies and early clinical trials. Studies\
  \ are currently being published demonstrating the safety of intrapenile injection\
  \ of autologous bone marrow- and adipose tissue-derived stem cells. Soebadi MA,\
