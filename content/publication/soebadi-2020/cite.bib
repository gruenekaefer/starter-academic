 abstract = {Objectives: To test the hypothesis that an implantable sensing system containing accelerometers can detect small-scale autonomous movements, also termed micromotions, which might be relevant to bladder physiology. Methods: We developed a 6-mm submucosal implant containing a pressure sensor (MS5637) and a triaxial accelerometer (BMA280). Sensor prototypes were tested by implantation in the bladders of Gottingen minipigs. Repeated awake voiding cystometry was carried out with air-charged catheters in a standard urodynamic set-up as comparators. We identified four phases of voiding similar to cystometry in other animal models based on submucosal pressure. Acceleration signals were separated by frequency characteristics to isolate linear acceleration from the baseline acceleration. The total linear acceleration was calculated by the root mean square of the three measurement axes. Acceleration activity during voiding was investigated to adjacent 1-s windows and was compared with the registered pressure. Results: We observed a total of 19 consecutive voids in five measurement sessions. A good correlation (r \textgreater 0.75) was observed between submucosal and catheter pressure in 14 of 19 premicturition traces. The peak-to-peak interval between maximum total linear acceleration was correlated with the interval between submucosal voiding pressure peaks (r = 0.760, P \textless 0.001). The total linear acceleration was higher during voiding compared with pre- and postmicturition periods (start of voiding/phase 1). Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of bladder wall acceleration, a novel metric that reflects bladder wall movement. Submucosal sensors containing accelerometers can measure bladder pressure and acceleration.},
