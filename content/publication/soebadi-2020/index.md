abstract: 'Objectives: To test the hypothesis that an implantable sensing system containing
  accelerometers can detect small-scale autonomous movements, also termed micromotions,
  which might be relevant to bladder physiology. Methods: We developed a 6-mm submucosal
  implant containing a pressure sensor (MS5637) and a triaxial accelerometer (BMA280).
  Sensor prototypes were tested by implantation in the bladders of Gottingen minipigs.
  Repeated awake voiding cystometry was carried out with air-charged catheters in
  a standard urodynamic set-up as comparators. We identified four phases of voiding
  similar to cystometry in other animal models based on submucosal pressure. Acceleration
  signals were separated by frequency characteristics to isolate linear acceleration
  from the baseline acceleration. The total linear acceleration was calculated by
  the root mean square of the three measurement axes. Acceleration activity during
  voiding was investigated to adjacent 1-s windows and was compared with the registered
  pressure. Results: We observed a total of 19 consecutive voids in five measurement
  sessions. A good correlation (r textgreater 0.75) was observed between submucosal
  and catheter pressure in 14 of 19 premicturition traces. The peak-to-peak interval
  between maximum total linear acceleration was correlated with the interval between
  submucosal voiding pressure peaks (r = 0.760, P textless 0.001). The total linear
  acceleration was higher during voiding compared with pre- and postmicturition periods
  (start of voiding/phase 1). Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the
  first report of bladder wall acceleration, a novel metric that reflects bladder
  wall movement. Submucosal sensors containing accelerometers can measure bladder
  pressure and acceleration.'
