 abstract = {AbstractObjective: To prove that ureteric jet examination using Color Doppler Ultrasonography (CDU) can be used as a diagnostic tool to predict success of retrograde Double J Stent insertion in uterine cervicis carcinoma patients with hydronephrosis.Materials and Methods: This observational analytic study took 32 samples since May until October 2013. Before, the ureteric jet were counted for 5 minutes using CDU, then continued on the same day with cystoscopy and retrograde DJ Stent insertion. The analysis was using Chi-Square and also Coefficient Contingency test.Results: In both Chi-Square and Coefficient Contingency test, it is proven a significant correlation between success of retrograde DJ Stent insertion and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), creatinine value, grade of hydronephrosis and also ureteric jet examination using CDU, with probability value (p \textless 0,005). The normal of BUN, creatinine level and the lower grading of hydronephrosis, the more likely successful DJ Stent insertion. Successfulness of DJ Stent insertion is also greater in a positive ureteric jet samples on examination using CDU, with sensitivity value 90,9% and specificity 89,5%, positive predictor value 83,3%, negative predictor value 95% and accuracy value 0,9.Conclusion: Ureteric jet frequency examination using CDU can be used as a success predictor of retrograde DJ Stent insertion in hydronephrosis uterine cervicis carcinoma patients with sensitivity value 90,9% and specificity 89,5%.Keywords: Ureteric jet, Color Doppler Ultrasonography, Double J Stent, Uterine Cervicis Carcinoma},
