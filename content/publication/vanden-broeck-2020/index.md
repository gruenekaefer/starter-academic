abstract: 'Introduction: Previous research in the field of cardiovascular diseases
  suggests a relaxing effect of testosterone (T) on smooth muscle cells. Therefore,
  it was hypothesized that T could play a significant role in erection development.
  Aim: To investigate the relaxing effect of T and other molecules of the T signaling
  pathway on human corpus cavernosum (HCC) tissue. Methods: Samples of the HCC tissue
  were obtained from men who underwent penile prosthesis implantation (n = 33) for
  erectile dysfunction. Samples were used for isometric tension measurement in Ex
  Vivo experiments. Following standardized precontraction with phenylephrine, increasing
  doses of T or dihydrotestosterone were administered and blocked by NO/H2S synthesis
  inhibitors, a KATP blocker, and flutamide (androgen receptor inhibitor). Main Outcome
  Measure: The outcome was relaxation of the HCC tissue, normalized to a maximum precontraction
  achieved by phenylephrine. Results: A dose-dependent relaxing effect of dihydrotestosterone
  and T was observed with a relaxation of, respectively, 24.9% ± 23.4% (P textless.
  0001) and 41.7% ± 19.1% (P = .01) compared with 6.8% ± 15.9% for vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide)
  at 300 $μ$M. The relaxing effect of T was not countered by blocking NO synthesis,
  H2S synthesis, KATP channels, or the androgen receptor. Clinical Implications: By
  understanding the underlying mechanisms of T-induced HCC relaxation, potential new
  therapeutic targets can be identified. Strengths & Limitations: The strength of
  the study is the use of fresh HCC tissues with reproducible results. The limitation
  is the need for supraphysiological T levels to induce the observed effect. Conclusion:
  Rapid androgen-induced relaxation of HCC is likely to occur via nongenomic mechanisms.
  Previously suggested mechanisms of action by which T modulates HCC relaxation have
  been excluded. Van den Broeck T, Soebadi MA, Falter A, et al. Testosterone Induces
