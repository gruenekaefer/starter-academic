abstract: Bladder dysfunctions form a continuously growing problem as the ageing population
  in our society is steadily increasing. However, scientific knowledge about the fundamental
  principles underlying bladder diseases is still lacking. Conventional cystometry-based
  methods for assessing bladder function are quite limited in their scope. In this
  paper, a novel device is introduced to research the bladder. An exploratory device
  was designed for measuring bladder wall contractions in rats using accelerometers.
  Later, a fully implantable system was created to extend the measurements to larger
  animal models. The battery-powered implant provides a wireless readout of multiple
  sensors with synchronous visualization. An intelligent algorithm is used to optimize
  the power consumption and to extend the autonomy after implantation, yielding a
  useable measurement time of 16 continuous days and several months of standby-time.
