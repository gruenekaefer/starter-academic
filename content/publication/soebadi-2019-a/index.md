abstract: AIMS To determine factors for treatment persistence in a real-life cohort
  of adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction. METHODS We reviewed records
  of patients with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction and mirabegron prescriptions.
  Exclusion criteria were indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheters and implanted
  neurostimulators. We extracted demographic data, indication for prescription, concomitant
  use of other agents with possible anticholinergic effect, beta blockers, duration
  of treatment and reason of discontinuation. RESULTS We included 110 subjects in
  this study. Neurologic diagnoses included multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease,
  and other diagnoses (dementia, paraplegia, and tetraplegia). Previous usage of antimuscarinics
  was found in 78 patients (71%). Mirabegron was combined with antimuscarinics in
  15 patients (14%). Drugs with any anticholinergic activity were taken by 94 subjects
  (86%). Mirabegron was taken for a median of 497 days and 60 patients discontinued
  the medication within the study period. Main reasons of discontinuation were lack
  of effect (44/110), side effects (10/110), and non-reimbursement (6/110). There
  were no differences in mirabegron discontinuation by neurological disease, beta
  blocker usage, or anticholinergic burden. CONCLUSIONS Mirabegron is continued in
  more than half of patients with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction for more
  than 6 months. Further research is needed to identify eventual predictive factors.
