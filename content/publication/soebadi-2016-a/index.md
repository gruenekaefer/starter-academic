abstract: "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize recent literature on basic stem cell research\
  \ in erectile dysfunction in cavernous nerve injury, aging, diabetes, and Peyronie's\
  \ disease and to provide a perspective on clinical translation of these cellular\
  \ therapies.$backslash$n$backslash$nRECENT FINDINGS: Stem cell research has been\
  \ concentrated on mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells from bone marrow and adipose\
  \ tissue. Application of both cell types has produced positive effects on erectile\
  \ function in various animal models of erectile dysfunction. In acute animal models,\
  \ such as cavernous nerve injury-induced erectile dysfunction and chemically induced\
  \ Peyronie's disease, engraftment and differentiation have not been observed, and\
  \ stem cells are believed to interact with the host tissue in a paracrine fashion,\
  \ whereas in chronic disease models some evidence suggests both engraftment and\
  \ paracrine factors may support improved function. Clinical trials are now investigating\
  \ therapeutic efficacy of cellular therapy, whereas the first safety studies in\
  \ humans have recently been published.$backslash$n$backslash$nSUMMARY: Evidence\
  \ from preclinical studies has established stem cells as a potential curative treatment\
  \ for erectile dysfunction and early phase clinical trials are currently performed."
