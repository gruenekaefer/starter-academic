abstract: 'Objectives: We analyze our data of patients with urinary retention that
  have been managed in Soetomo general hospital to know our prevalence, causes and
  its management. Material & methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records
  of the patients with urinary retention who admitted on our department between January
  2011 and December 2012. Results: During 2 years between January 2011 until December
  2012, a total number of urinary retention was 295 cases among 1282 urology emergency
  cases, with sex ratio of urinary retention in men and women was 85.7% : 14.3%. Of
  the study population 264 (89.5%) presented with acute urine retention while 31 (10.5%)
  had chronic urine retention. Most of urinary retention was caused by bladder stone
  (33.3%) in children, urethral stricture (26.8%) in young adult men, BPH (71.3%)
  in elder men and cystitis (26.3%) in women. Trial of voiding without catheter (TWOC)
  that performed in 60 of the BPH patients, was succeeded in 43 (71.6%) of the patients
  and failed in 17 (28.4%). Emergency treatment of urinary retention were urethral
  catheter (83.7%) and cystostomy (16.3%). Conclusion: Urinary retention is one of
  emergency in urology that most common occur in men. Urine retention found among
  the participants was mainly AUR rather than CUR. Most of urinary retention was caused
  by bladder stone in children, urethral stricture in young adult men, BPE in elder
  men and cystitis in women. The most emergency management was urethral catheter.
  Trial of voiding without catheter showed a high success rate, so it can be considered
  as definitive non-surgical therapy in selective patient.'
