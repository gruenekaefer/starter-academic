abstract: 'AbstractObjective:Â  To prove that ureteric jet examination using Color
  Doppler Ultrasonography (CDU) can be used as a diagnostic tool to predict success
  of retrograde Double J Stent insertion in uterine cervicis carcinoma patients with
  hydronephrosis.Materials and Methods: This observational analytic study took 32
  samples since May until October 2013. Before, the ureteric jet were counted for
  5 minutes using CDU, then continued on the same day with cystoscopy and retrograde
  DJ Stent insertion. The analysis was using Chi-Square and also Coefficient Contingency
  test.Results: In both Chi-Square and Coefficient Contingency test, it is proven
  a significant correlation between success of retrograde DJ Stent insertion and Blood
  Urea Nitrogen (BUN), creatinine value, grade of hydronephrosis and also ureteric
  jet examination using CDU, with probability value (p textless 0,005). The normal
  of BUN, creatinine level and the lower grading of hydronephrosis, the more likely
  successful DJ Stent insertion. Successfulness of DJ Stent insertion is also greater
  in a positive ureteric jet samples on examination using CDU, with sensitivity value
  90,9% and specificity 89,5%, positive predictor value 83,3%, negative predictor
  value 95% and accuracy value 0,9.Conclusion: Ureteric jet frequency examination
  using CDU can be used as a success predictor of retrograde DJ Stent insertion in
  hydronephrosis uterine cervicis carcinoma patients with sensitivity value 90,9%
  and specificity 89,5%.Keywords: Ureteric jet, Color Doppler Ultrasonography, Double
